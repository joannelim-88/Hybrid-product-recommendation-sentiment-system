# Overview
This project consists of two hybrid machine learning models for E-commerce use cases. 

Model 1: Hybrid product recommendation model using LightFM and SVD algorithms
- Dataset: female_customer_transactions.csv
- Kaggle dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chilledwanker/supermarket-data-for-customer-segmentation
- Purpose in E-commerce: To return Top 5 recommended products based on consumer product interactions and purchasing history.

Model 2: Hybrid sentiment analysis model using Naive Bayes and BERT algorithms
- Dataset: Reviews.csv
- Kaggle dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
- Purpose in E-commerce: To analyse and return sentiment results based on customer reviews for a better feedback system.
